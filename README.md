# Oil Rig Simulator Prototype

This repository contains a minimal C++ prototype for the Oil Rig Simulator game described in the accompanying UML documentation.

## Building

Ensure you have a C++17 compiler. To build the demo executable, run:

```bash
make
```

This will produce an executable named `ors`.

## Running

Execute the program after building:

```bash
./ors
```

The demo showcases creating a company, operating an oil rig through a simple contract, and updating the market price.
